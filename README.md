# TRAFFIC-PATTERNS-ANALYSIS-NM

🚦 TRAFFIC PATTERNS ANALYSIS


📌 Introduction

Traffic congestion is a common issue in urban environments, affecting productivity, pollution levels, and quality of life. This project simulates traffic data and analyzes vehicle flow patterns using Python-based data visualization techniques. It aims to identify trends across different hours and days to support smarter traffic management decisions.

🎯 Objective

Simulate and analyze traffic volume data across different timeframes

Visualize traffic behavior using line plots, heatmaps, and bar charts

Highlight peak hours and weekly patterns in vehicle flow

Provide an intuitive, visual basis for further traffic optimization research

📊 Data Source
Simulated Dataset:

Traffic data is generated using NumPy and Pandas to simulate realistic hourly traffic variations based on sinusoidal patterns.

60 hours of data

Hourly vehicle counts

Features: datetime, vehicle_count, hour, day


🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Traffic simulation

Matplotlib – Line and bar plots

Seaborn – Heatmaps


📈 Visualizations


📉 Line Graph – Traffic Over Time (Hour-Colored):

Visualizes changes in vehicle count over time

Hour of the day shown using a plasma color gradient

🗺️ Heatmap – Average Traffic by Hour & Weekday:

Shows average vehicle count by day of the week and hour of day

Useful to identify rush hours and low-traffic periods

📊 Bar Chart – Daily Average Vehicle Count:

Daily average vehicle count visualized with gradient bars

Useful for comparing traffic volume across different days
